# Welcome to the Contacts-Manager-Project

This project was created as part of a assignment from [Softuni](https://softuni.bg/), during the Python Fundamentals Course.

### The Main Contributors are:

* [Antonia Antonova](https://github.com/AntonovaAntonia)

### The aim of the Project was to create a Contact- Mangaer "like" system. That runs in a Python Console.
- If You'd like to Try the program, as and executable just download the [Contact-manager.exe](https://github.com/SimeonTsvetanov/Contacts-Manager-Project/blob/master/Contact-Manager.exe) Install it somewhere on your computer and run the file.

- If You'd like to Try the program, in your Python console just download the [contact_manager_project.py](https://github.com/SimeonTsvetanov/Mini-Projects-Learning-Python/blob/master/Contacts-Manager-Project-master/Contacts_manager_projet.py) file. And run it in any Python console. 
The program will create additional File, for storing all the Contacts if one is needed.
