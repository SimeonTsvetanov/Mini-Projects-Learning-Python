# Welcome to the To-Do-Manager-Project

***
This project was created as part of a assignment from [Softuni](https://softuni.bg/), during the Python Fundamentals Course.


### The aim of the Project was to create a To-Do-List "like" GUI Program with Python. That runs in its own GUI and uses data base, to save the data for later.
If You'd like to Try the program, just download the [To-Do-GUI-App.py](https://github.com/SimeonTsvetanov/To-Do-Manager-Project/blob/master/To-Do-GUI-App.py) file. And run it in any Python console. 
The program will create additional File, for storing all the Tasks if one is needed.

### The program has a basic menu with 5 Buttons: ###
- ***Add Task***: To create a new Task.
- ***Show All***: To Show all current Tasks.
- ***Delete Selected***: To Delete selected from the list task.
- ***Delete All***: To Delete all the tasks.
- ***Exit***: To exit the program.

### It also has 3 different extra interactive fields. ###
- ***First***: Interactive field - It will give you feedback for the usage of the program
- ***Second***: Add Task Entry Field - In this field you can enter text. And then to add it as a task, by clickig the Add Task Butoon
- ***Third***: Large Text Field - In this text field, you will be able to see all the tasks in the program.
