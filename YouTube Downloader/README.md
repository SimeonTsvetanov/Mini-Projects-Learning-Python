# Youtube Downloader

Youtube Downloader is extremely simple program for downloading songs or playlists (in audio or video) from YouTube.

## Installation
NO INSTALLATION required Just Download the [YouTube Downloader.exe](https://github.com/SimeonTsvetanov/Mini-Projects-Learning-Python/blob/master/YouTube%20Downloader/Youtube%20Downloader.exe) Application on your PC. 
Just Bypass the Windows Security (It seems to have problem with programs ported with pyinstaller.)

```bash
If you select just one song, it will be saved in the same folder with the application.
If you select a playlist, it will be downloaded in a sub folder named after the playlist.
```

Bypass the Windows Security as it's ported with pyinstaller (no way around it)

The program will download the selected Song/Playlist. 
```
