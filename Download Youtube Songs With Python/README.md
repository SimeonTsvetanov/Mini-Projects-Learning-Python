# Youtube Downloader

Youtube Downloader is extremely simple program for downloading songs or playlists (in audio or video) from YouTube.

## Installation
NO INSTALLATION required Just Download the YouTube Downloader.exe Application on your PC. 
Just Bypass the Windows Security (It seems to have problem with programs ported with pyinstaller.)

```bash
If you select just one song, it will be saved in the same folder with the application.
If you select a playlist, it will be downloaded in a sub folder named after the playlist.
```

## Usage

```python
Download the app
Bypass the Windows Security as it's ported with pyinstaller (no way around it)
# A script window will appear prompting you to fill in the (s or p) for just A SONG or PLAYLIST and (a or v) for AUDIO or VIDEO.
# And it will require the link from YouTube. 

Enter the Song and hit ENTER

# As long as the input data is correct:

The program will download the selected Song/Playlist. 
```
